              Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the
              acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.
              Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling,
              discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place
              under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate
              themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
              settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way
              one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The
              methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
